## What this project is about

This project is a technincal asigment from PXL widget. The assignment is as follows :

Connect to the BreweryDB API. Your task is to list beer brands per country, provide a search field for them by name and filter/group them by country and by type. Try to use the most efficient methods of calling the api’s endpoints and sorting and filtering the data.

Note that the breweryDB exposes a limited data-set and most beers and breweries will be American with some noteworthy exceptions.

You get to pick the JS framework of your choice -- of course you’re also allowed to not use a framework at all (that is discouraged though! :)

Bonus points for efficient employment of general-purpose JS libraries such as Lodash, RxJS, Ramda or similar. Showing when -- and when not -- to use these is highly appreciated!

JS framework of your choice.
Usage of typescript is preferred.
Points for using general libraries like rxjs, ramda, lodash.
Optionally create a minimal NodeJS server as adapter- and caching-layer for the API data.
Use GIT, please provide us with a link to your repository when done and include a README describing the decisions you made to accomplish the assignment.
